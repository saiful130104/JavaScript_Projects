## TaskList(Fifth project done in the above course.)
### About the TaskList project
  There is a input field where you can input any task and a button to add that task. Also delete or update. Actually this is for CRUD operation learning with OOP concept.

- create 3 classes for task, ui and ls.
- check a tick mark for defining the status of any task is completed or not.
- data stored in the LocalStorage

### Learning from TaskList project
- prototype concept understanding.
- conversion from prototype to ES6 class type.
- update any data and store that in the localstorage.
- besides there is a lot of things those have been learnt automatically which is making me **confident**.
